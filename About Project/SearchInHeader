1) URLSearchParams is a built-in JavaScript class that provides methods and properties to work with the query string of a URL. It allows you to parse, manipulate, and stringify query parameters easily.

 2) A query string is a part of a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that contains data to be passed to the server as key-value pairs. It appears after the question mark (?) in the URL and is composed of multiple parameters separated by ampersands (&).

 ex:- Here's an example URL with a query string:

https://example.com/search?q=apple&category=fruits&page=1.

The base URL is https://example.com/search.
The query string starts with ?.
There are three parameters: q, category, and page.
Each parameter is separated by an ampersand (&).
Each parameter consists of a key and a value separated by an equal sign (=). For example, q=apple means the value of the q parameter is "apple".

3) new URLSearchParams(location.search):
location.search refers to the query string portion of the current URL. For example, in the URL https://example.com/search?query=hello, the query string is ?query=hello.
new URLSearchParams() is a built-in JavaScript class that allows you to work with the query parameters of a URL.


4)  How it works :-
When i click on the search  and write anything and then SearchTerm state gets the written text in search bar
